They can be individual vendors, or some established brands who want to enhance their presence in the digital world. Our vendors will register themselves with us on some Monthly Subscription Charges/ Platform fees. We shall verify the authenticity of vendors by taking their basic information and prepare an agreement with them. Similarly our customers/buyers shall also be registered with us on our ecommerce store. The customers will be able to see the vendor profile, rate them (after getting services), make their purchases and keep themselves updated with the products in the market. For instance we have a vendor/store registered as Ali Electronics which deals with all kind of home appliances. Let say, Ayesha wants to buy an electric kettle and she upon searching finds her desired product on Ali Electronics. She will place her order and make her payment in advance which will be in Company’s Account until the order is completed. Ali Electronics will receive a notification about the order. He will pack the relevant product and will dispatch it through our service (Our defined courier services through our account). Once Miss Ayesha receives the product and verifies that she got the desired product, the payment will be released and will reach the vendor account in defined period of time (15 days).\nNote: Non Verified & Unregistered Members can only surf the products on ISMMART stores but are not allowed to trade.

It can take three to fourteen business days. Along with the money you paid for the returned product, the shipping cost is also repaid.\nFor example, when Ayesha receives the product, she finds it faulty. She will lodge a complaint at our complaint center, where we shall contact with the vendor for resolution. If her claim is proven right, she will return the faulty item back to the vendor, and her payment (which was kept on hold by ISMMART will be retrieved back to her.
